# EFIS Display
This is a software EFIS panel that I am working on that will be able to integrate with flight
simulators to provide an auxiliary display.
 
## Current Planned Features

- Speed tape (Done)

- Artificial Horizon (TODO)
- Some additional indicators (TODO)

## XPlane Integration
Currently, the XPlane API that is being used in this project comes from this 
[NASA repo](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect).  In order for the API to work the separate 
plugin from that repo needs to be added to your XPlane install.

## MSF2020 Integration
This is TBD.  It all depends on how easy it is to integrate with the official SDK.
